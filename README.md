# GoLang-Backend
This is a experiment for creating a golang backend by creating simple CRUD operations.

some of the useful commands for golang.

- `go install` is used to install a binary, not a package

- `go get` to download a package

- `go mod tidy` scans your project and updates the go.mod file and downloads all dependencies mentioned in the go.mod file

- `go mod download` only downloads the dependencies from go.mod, without modifications of the go.mod file
